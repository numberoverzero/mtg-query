##Code

####Inline

You can use single backticks like this: `` `<script>alert("XSS!");</script>` `` to escape small bits of code in-line.

####Four spaces
```
    <blink>Four spaces before each line</blink>
    (God blink's awful)

    Linking doesn't work [the gewgle](google.com)
```

####Backticks (fenced code blocks)

Or use 3 (or more) backticks before and after the code
Like this:

``````
```
<blink>Backticks before and after code</blink>
(God blink's awful)

Linking doesn't work [the gewgle](google.com)
```
``````

##Emphasis

####Bold (strong)

`**someone please ban bob.**` produces **someone please ban bob.**

`__someone please ban bob.__` produces __someone please ban bob.__

####Italic (em)

`*not sure if...*` produces *not sure if...*

`_not sure if..._` produces _not sure if..._

####Inner-word underscores

Using underscores inside of a word is fine:

`_not_sure_if_srs_` produces _not_sure_if_srs_

####Bold and Italic

`***What?!***` produces ***What?!***

`*__What?!__*` produces *__What?!__*

##Escaping

You can escape most markdown characters by putting a slash "\" in front of them.  This is particularly useful for emphasis:

`*Say what again, motherf**cker.*` produces *Say what again, motherf**cker.*

with escaping:

`*Say what again, motherf\*\*cker.*` produces *Say what again, motherf\*\*cker.*

####Titles

Your references don't need to go directly after the link, they can be anywhere...

```
1. One small catch:
4. the numbers you use
2. don't matter
200. it always starts at one

Watch out! The following will trigger an ordered list:

    1296.  Very good year! Almost as old as I am! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one?
1296.  Very good year! Almost as old as I am! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one?

To avoid this, escape with a "\":

    1296\.  Very good year! Almost as old as I am! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one?
1296\.  Very good year! Almost as old as I am! It was laid down by my father. What say we open one?
