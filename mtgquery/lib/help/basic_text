##Synergy{: #synergy}

####What is Synergy?

Synergy is an easy way to link to a few cards that work well together.  Of course, you can still use Synergy for [combos](/s/Xi2PK) :)

Here's a [slightly longer synergy](/s/WyXa4).

For example, [[Doubling Season]] and [[Tamiyo, the Moon Sage]] allow you to use Tamiyo's ultimate as soon as she enters the battlefield.  Use [Synergy](/submit) instead of saving the images for both of those cards, editing them together and then uploading to a cool image hosting site like [imgur](http://www.imgur.com).

1. Enter a title for our synergy (optional)
2. Give a brief description of what's going on (optional)
3. Enter one card per line
4. [Synergize!](/s/JYhaz)

But Doubling Season works well for any planeswalker.  Instead of using a specific planeswalker, we can also insert [arbitrary text](/s/onYy4)!

##Entering cards{: #entering-cards}

####Card Lists

* Capitalization is not important.
* By default, a card name alone means a quantity of one, in the most recent printing.
* You do not need to use special characters.  `aether flash` will properly resolve to [[aether flash]].
* Exact set names take priority over newer set names that are a partial match. *(see Special Set Notes)*

    Input                     | Output
    ------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    `Mizzium Mortars`         | 1 copy of [[Mizzium Mortars]] from Return to Ravnica (most recent)
    `3 Kird Ape`              | 3 copies of [[Kird Ape]] from From the Vault: Exiled (most recent)
    `2 Kird Ape : Revised`    | 2 copies of [[Kird Ape : Revised]] from Revised
    `Ornithopter : Mirr`      | 1 copy of [[Ornithopter : Mirr]] from Mirrodin (partial set name match)
    `4 Time Walk : Darksteel` | 4 copies of [[Time Walk : Darksteel]] from Unlimited (wasn't printed in Darksteel, defaults to most recent)

#####Special Set Notes

Copper Myr is interesting.  Printed in [[copper myr:Mirrodin"Mirrodin"]], then [[copper myr:Planechase"Planechase"]], and then [[copper myr:Scars of Mirrodin"Scars of Mirrodin"]],  any part of the word "Mirrodin" such as `Copper Myr : Mirr` will give us the **most recent set that partially matches** (which is Scars of Mirrodin).  The only way to specify the Mirrodin printing is to provide the exact set name: `4 Copper Myr : mirrodin`.  


####Card Text Formatting

Very similar to above, just put a `#` in front of your text.

* `#Any Planeswalker` for one copy of "Any Planeswalker"
* `2 #Any elf` for 2 copies of ["Any elf"](/s/asEAk)


####Markup - Popups in Descriptions

Similar to the above formatting, with these changes:

1. Surround card names in double brackets.  `[[Island]]` becomes [[Island]].
2. You can specify alternate text using quotes.  The infamous [[dark confidant "Bob"]] can be rendered using `[[dark confidant "Bob"]]`.
3. Set and alternate text are both optional.  These are all valid:
    
    Input | Output
    ----- | -----
    `[[Black Lotus"Unlimited isn't too expensive"]]` | [[Black Lotus"Unlimited isn't too expensive"]]
    `[[Black Lotus:Beta"But Beta is"]]` | [[Black Lotus:Beta"But Beta is"]]
